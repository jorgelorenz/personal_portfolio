# Personal portfolio
This is my portfolio with some personal projects that I have been working on.


## Projects:


·Maze generation algorithm with linear programming.([Open in Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1X0ESau_97QNLvUhsdpZEg4a_zORWney9?usp=sharing))
~~~
What I used:
·Linear Programming and Latex for writing the problem.

·Python: CVXPY for solving the optimization problem and Pandas for visualizing the efficiency of the algorithm.
