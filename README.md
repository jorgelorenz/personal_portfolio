# Personal portfolio
This is my portfolio with some personal projects that I have been working on.

Developing... There will be updates soon.
## Projects:
·A Quantitative Finance library in python.([Open](https://github.com/jorgelorenz/personal_portfolio/tree/main/QuantFinance))
~~~
The idea is developing a general framework with multiple simulation tools and customizables payoffs.
At the moment the library has the following tools.

Pricing tools for:
·Standar IRS Swap with different: Business day convention, calendar adjustment, frequency, etc...
·European Vanilla Options
·Digital Options
·Barrier Options
·Asian Options
·Future Options
·Caps, Floors
·American, Bermudan
·Soon: Swaptions, Multi-asset products, Structured products

The above pricing tools are based on closed formulas and the following simulation tools.
Simulation Tools:
·Shifted Lognormal, Black-Scholes and Black 76 models
·Bachelier model
·Binomial model: Jarrow-Rudd Tree, ...
·Soon: Hull-White Simulator, Multi-Asset simulators, Local Volatility models, Cox-Ross-Rubinstein, Black-Derman-Toy, , Stochastic Volatility models

~~~

·Final thesis for BSc in Mathematics (spanish version).([Open](https://github.com/jorgelorenz/personal_portfolio/blob/main/TFG%20final.pdf))
~~~
Contents:
·Brief introduction section on stock market and derivatives for non-finance background people.
·Derivatives pricing: Stochastic calculus, Itô's integral, Black-Scholes model and equation, Fundamental Theorem of asset pricing.
·Numerical methods: Monte-carlo model, tree models, EDP numerical solutions, Malliavin calculus.

·Final thesis for BSc in Computer Science (spanish version).([Open](https://github.com/jorgelorenz/personal_portfolio/blob/main/TFG%20Inform%C3%A1tica%20final.pdf))
~~~
Contents:
·Brief introduction section on stock market and derivatives for non-finance background people and forecasting with statistic and machine learning.
·Introduction based on own interpretation of the time series analysis theory.
·Introduction to machine learning models and their training.

~~~

·Maze generation algorithm with linear programming.([Open in Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1X0ESau_97QNLvUhsdpZEg4a_zORWney9?usp=sharing))
~~~
What I used:
·Linear Programming and Latex for writing the problem.

·Python: CVXPY for solving the optimization problem and Pandas for visualizing the efficiency of the algorithm.
~~~

·Approximating log-normal distribution by binomial model.([Open in Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sKPsxRBTrLpTY_9qBMY5P2XkvhtLpepc?usp=sharing))
~~~
What I used:
·Quantitative finance and Latex for writing the problem.

·Python: NumPy, Pandas and Seaborn for visualizing the approximation.
~~~
